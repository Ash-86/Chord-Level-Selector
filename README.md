# Chord-Level-Filter *for MuseScore 4.x*
A MuseScore 4.x Plugin with UI to select and operate on desired chord levels within a range selection.

## Disclaimer
This script was inspired by worldwideweary's "Chord Level Selector". 
Most portion of the main function were re-written (except for the get chords section), some bugs fixed (see below) and other funcionalities were added; specifically, the options "Copy levels", and "Crop to levels".
The UI was also redesigned to contain the new functionalities and level boxes where regrouped into a single vertical column, now with the "bottom note" on the bottom.

## Changes and bug fixes
1. you can now delete multiple levels at the same time correctly. (it was deleting wrong levels when multiple ones selected)
2. The plugin can now identify the top note and the level number corresponding to it, so no issues occur when deleting both top note and the corresponding level number.
3. A new copy option is added, well, for copying selected levels. 
4. A new "crop to levels" option is added for quicker pruning.
5. level buttons were rearranged vertically and "bottom note" is now , well, at the bottom (seemed more intuitive to me)
